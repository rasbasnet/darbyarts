            <h3>Materials & process</h3>
            <p>
              Drawings begin with tight graphite or charcoal foundations before layers of gesso, pastel, and expired
              cosmetics are buffed in. The result is a surface that feels both clinical and confectionary.

            <h3>Series threads</h3>
            <p>
              Works from <em>Performative Appetites</em> and <em>Portals</em> consider the mouth as both an invitation and a
              dare. Earlier anatomical pieces reimagine medical illustration as a map for feeling.

            <h3>Acquisitions</h3>

              request additional documentation.
